# CampQuiz

A simple quiz game built with JavaScript and jQuery.

#Description
The Quiz Game is a web-based application that presents a series of multiple-choice questions to the user. The user has a limited amount of time to answer each question, and their score is calculated based on the number of correct answers and the time remaining. At the end of the quiz, the user can view their score and submit it to the high score leaderboard.

#Features
Randomized questions: The quiz questions are randomly shuffled each time the game starts, providing a different order of questions for each playthrough.
Timer: A countdown timer is displayed for each question, and the user must answer before time runs out.
Score calculation: The user's score is calculated based on the number of correct answers and the time remaining.
High score leaderboard: Users can submit their scores and view the highest scores on the leaderboard.
Persistence: High scores are saved to local storage, allowing the user to view them even after closing and reopening the application.
